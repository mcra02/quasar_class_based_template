Powered by [Maicol](https://github.com/mcra02) with the goal of optimize our development processes, we are happy to introduce our templates boilerplate packed and ready to use with the following features:

- **Python** 3.8
- **Cookiecutter** 1.7.2

1. First, get [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter). Trust me, it's awesome:

    ```bash
    $ pip install cookiecutter
    ```

2. Run against this repo

    ```bash

    You will be prompted for some values. Provide them, then a Quasar Class Component template will be created for you.
